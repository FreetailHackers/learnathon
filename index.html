                A Learnathon is a virtual two-day event held on April 3rd and 4th by Freetail Hackers for students of ALL backgrounds to learn about technology. 
                We want to create an inclusive space for anyone interested in technology to learn and explore it. Attendees will get the chance to learn new skills, 
                meet other people going through the learning journey, and create a project to showcase!

                        The Learnathon is designed to help people from all backgrounds transform from tadpoles to code toads! 
                        On Saturday, April 3rd, we will have a day specifically designed for workshops. 
                        Most of these workshops will assume no prior knowledge and will be a space for anyone to learn. 
                        On Sunday, April 4th, we will have a hackathon that will give attendees a chance to use what they have learned to build a project. 
                        This can sound scary at first but we will give you the tools you need to go from no programming experience to building a project! 
                        Of course, the experience can be personalized as attendees have the option of attending just one or both of the two events.

                        Even if you’re just vaguely interested in what the buzz around tech is, we are happy and excited to give you a glimpse into it. 
                        Additionally, all workshops will be recorded unless noted otherwise, so don’t worry if you can’t make it to a specific time; 
                        you can always watch afterwards.

                We're a group of UT Austin students who love organizing hackathons for college students.
                We also love going to them. If you enjoy both of these, you should apply to our team when applications open in December!
                Applications will be posted on our Facebook page. Need to reach out to us for any further questions or want to work with us for the next event?
                Email us at hello@freetailhackers.com!

                As mentioned, the Learnathon is designed for everyone. In order to have a space that truly fosters growth, 
                we require that all our attendees, mentors, and organizers are respectful of each other. 
                To that end, all participants are expected to follow the

                    <p>Teams can be up to 4 members. If you don't have a team, check out our Facebook group. Joining a team of new friends is the best part of a hackathon. We will have team matching available for everyone on the day of the event, but if
                        you would like to message our channel and create a team beforehand, that's okay too! We will have a spreadsheet to fill out and confirm team information.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">How do I volunteer?</p>
                    <p>Simply email us at hello@freetailhackers.com to see how you can get involved! We are in great of need of mentors to coach teams throughout the process, and anyone with tech experience is welcome to help out.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">How much money will this cost me?</p>
                    <p>Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers will provide all students with mentors, tech talks, and prizes!</p>

                <div class="right-column normal-text">
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Any rules?</p>
                    <p>All work must be done during the 36-hour period of the event. You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the MLH Code of Conduct.</p>

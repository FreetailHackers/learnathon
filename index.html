                According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. <br/><br/>
                The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is possible. <br/><br/>

                        If you ask Rick Astley for a DVD of the movie Up, he won’t give it to you because he’s 
                        never gonna give you Up. However, by not giving you Up like you asked for it, he’s letting you down. 
                        This is known as the Astley paradox.

                We also love going to them. If you enjoy both of these, you should apply to our team when applications open in December!
                Applications will be posted on our Facebook page. Need to reach out to us for any further questions or want to work with us for the next event?
                Email us at hello@freetailhackers.com!

                        you would like to message in our channel and create a team beforehand, that's okay too! We will have a spreadsheet to fill out and confirm team information.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">How do I volunteer?</p>
                    <p>Simply email us at hello@freetailhackers.com to see how you can get involved! We are in great of need of mentors to coach teams throughout the process, and anyone with tech experience is welcome to help out.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">How much money will this cost me?</p>
                    <p>Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers will provide all students with mentors, tech talks, and prizes!</p>

                    <p>All work must be done during the 36-hour period of the event. You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the MLH Code of Conduct.</p>
